Title:
appSHNE: The Application of Representation Learning for Semantic-Associated Heterogeneous Networks in Creating Android App Embedding Layers

Abstract:
Due to the open-source nature of the
Android application development system, the threat of malicious software being uploaded to the Android
marketplace and compromising the safety of millions of users is prevalent, and growing at an alarming rate. As
time goes on, attackers develop new techniques for evading detection. Even the current state-of-the-art models
often fall short when trying to represent complex relationships between different features of the code. In this
paper, we will be exploring the implementation of both structured and unstructured app features in the creation of representative embedding layers. This multi-faceted approach, at scale, offers researchers greater insight into the inner working of the app with deployment that ranges from malware detection to similarity search and link prediction.
